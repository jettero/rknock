- '@' support for --command (like for --secret)
  - I'm not happy with the command setup,
  - I think we need an external script

- in addition to the various ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES, we should have some config file support

- probably, since there's some overlap, we should have some kid of config.rs or build args in lib.rs or soemthing

- we're using tokio, but the blocking sleep (or let's say blocking working with the firewall commands) is still all serial...
