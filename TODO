- '@' support for --command (like for --secret)
  - I'm not happy with the command setup,
  - I think we need an external script

- in addition to the various ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES, we should
  have some config file support
  - probably, since there's some overlap, we should have some kid
    of config.rs or build args in lib.rs or soemthing
  - there aren't any good solutions for using clap with config
    files yet…
  - … but there are stubs to help me get to the point that I can
    combine them in regardless:
    https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/748#issuecomment-1232161125
    - note in particular, from the linked #2763 discussion, this
      package clap_conf:
      https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2763#discussioncomment-2834309
    - can't actually use clap_conf cuz it wants exactly ^2.3.0 of
      clap and I don't wanna go that old
    - but it's pretty close! \o/

- I'd like to get more of the dgram handler in the spawned
  coprocess (thread?). It's hard because I want to "globally"-ish
  track those nonces meaning they don't don't want to move into the
  `async move {}` block.

- see if we can switch to the derive version of the arguments, it
  does in fact look cleaner
