# knock knock

I don't like traditional port knocking... it's too easy for someone with tcpdump
to construct a replay. This is my attempt to improve on that slightly.

This project should in no way be considered to be more secure than the usual
port knocking though. We're relying on openssh (or whatever) to do the real
work.

This just opens the port for a few seconds.

# rust rust

I'm also just learning rust. I'm getting better at it, but I really don't know
what I'm doing. I'm using this messy app as my learning sandbox, so it's got a
lot of non-idiomatic-bs in it (as I slowly learn to stop resisting
rust-ifications).

It's also about 100 times more complicated than it needs to be wrt switches and
option parsing with configs and things. The reason is: so I can learn how to do
switches and options parsing.
